# Advanced Road Tools (ART)
---		
Advanced Road Tools (ART) is a mod that provides a variety of tools to control roads and their behaviour.

## Features
- **Zoning Controller Tool** - Control zoning on roads, with a previewable tool where you can just hover the road and see what you'll get! Right-Click inverts the current zoning configuration

### Planned Features
- **Parallel Tool** - Create parallel roads and tracks out of any network. This tool will allow you to create parallel roads out of train tracks, highways and tram tracks without the need of tracing them. Simply click them and see the new parallel road appear.
- **Advanced Grid Tool** - Create a grid by the amount of columns and rows that you want. Simply set 2 control points to define a rectangle, and then, on a pop-up window, set how many rows and columns you want and them confirm it. voila!
- **Control Zoning Depth** - Set zoning depth from 0 to 12 (or even more). Have EVEN MORE control over how zoning is generated on your roads. create a 2 deep zoning road for those nice warehouses, or 3 deep zoning road for those compact row homes. Or even, in the future, 12 deep zoning for 12x12 gigantic factories or mansions!
