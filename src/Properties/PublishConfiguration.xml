# ART-Zone
		
Custom zoning for new and existing roads.

## Features
Control zoning on roads
- Preview tool: just hover the road to see what you get instantly!
- Easy and Intuitive: Right-click flips the current zoning preview, Left click confirms.
- Adds a small “Zoning Side” panel next to the Road tabs and looks/acts like vanilla.
- New Roads, old Roads - no problem! - remembers your last selection of Both/none/left/right.
- Options to lock/protect existing buildings and already zoned grids from changing.
- Three ways to start zoning:
  - Top left icon (4 square symbol)
  - Roads Services tab (4 square symbol)
  - Optional Shift+z keybind

### Multi-Language UI (7)
* English, Français French, Español Spanish
* 日本語 Japanese, 한국어 Korean, 简体中文 Simplified Chinese
* Português Brazilian


## How to use
1. Open **Roads** → click the **ART-Zone** tool (4-squares icon).
2. **Zoning Side** mini-panel appears (Left / Right / Both / None).
3. **Hover a road** to see a preview of zoning cells.
4. **Right-Click** to cycle previews:
- **Left ↔ Right** when any side icon is selected.
- **Both ↔ None** when Both or None is selected.
5. **Left-Click** once to apply.
6. **Optional:** **Shift+Z** shortcut to open the tool panel (not required).

Tip: You can Right-Click multiple times to preview different outcomes, then Left-Click once to commit.

## Compatibility
- Safe to remove any time.
- This mod not use Harmony; safe/compatible (reduces possibility of breaking with every game update).
- Mod back-end design for robust, minimal, and low-conflict. Front-end for safe/intuitive UX (extends vanilla UI instead of replacing it).
- Uses the game’s input system; sounds and selection feedback designed to feel vanilla.
