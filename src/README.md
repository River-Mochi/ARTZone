# ART-Zone

- Edit zoning in Cities: Skylines II.
- **New roads** can inherit your active zoning side/depth choice (so your preference carries forward while building).
- Edit existing roads: intuitive, fast hover previews of zoning grids, RMB toggles choices and previews, one-click LMB apply, and a vanilla-style tool section.

---

## What it does
- **Zoning Side control** for any road: **Left**, **Right**, **Both**, or **None**.
- **Instant RMB preview toggle:**
  - If a side is selected (**Left** or **Right**), **Right-Click** flips **Left ↔ Right**.
  - If **Both/None** is selected, **Right-Click** flips **Both ↔ None**.
  - Works even when the road already matches the current state (you still get a flip/preview).
- **One-click apply:** **Left-Click** commits the preview to the hovered/selected road(s).
- **Vanilla-style UI:** small “Zoning Side” buttons appear in the small tool panel left of the roads tabs.

---

## How to use
1. Open **Roads** → click the **ART-Zone** tool (four-squares icon). The **Zoning Side** mini-panel appears (Left / Right / Both / None).
2. **Hover a road** to see the zoning preview for the current mode.
3. **Right-Click** to cycle previews:
   - **Left ↔ Right** when a side is selected.
   - **Both ↔ None** when Both/None is selected.
4. **Left-Click** once to **apply** your final choice.
5. **Esc** closes the panels when you’re done (same as vanilla).
6. **Optional:** **Shift+Z** can be used as a shortcut to open/close the tool panel (if bound on your setup). It’s not required—Esc and the panel close button also work.

> Tip: Right-Click multiple times to preview different outcomes, then Left-Click once to commit.

## Compatibility
- Safe to remove anytime.
- Designed to be minimal and conflict-free (extends vanilla UI panels).
- Uses the game’s input system; RMB sounds and selection feedback mirror vanilla behavior.

---

## Notes
- If a preview doesn’t show, make sure you’re hovering a **road segment** that supports zoning cells.

---

## Roadmap / Future
- **Topography (Contour Lines) support tool** in the same mini-panel (vanilla icon/tooltip).  
  Goal: toggle contour lines next to the ART-Zone controls for easier terrain-aware zoning.
