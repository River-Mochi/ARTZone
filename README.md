# ART-Zone

- Edit zoning in Cities: Skylines II.
- **New roads** inherit your active zoning side/depth choice (your preference applied while building).
- **Existing roads**: editing is intuitive, hover any road, instantly preview what will zone. Flip sides with Right-click, confirm with one Left-click.

---

## What it does
- **Zoning control** on roads: **Left**, **Right**, **Both**, or **None**.
- **Instant Right-click (RMB) preview flips:**
  - Select a side (**Left** or **Right**), then **Right-Click** swaps **Left ↔ Right**.
  - Select **Both or None**, then **Right-Click** swaps **Both ↔ None**.
  - You always get a live preview, even if the road is already zoned (can still flip/preview).
- **One-click apply:** Left-Click once to commit the preview of the hovered/selected road.
- **Vanilla-style UI:** “Zoning Side” buttons appear in a small tool panel left of the roads tabs.

---

## How to use
1. Open **Roads** → click the **ART-Zone** tool (four-squares icon). **Zoning Side** mini-panel appears (Left / Right / Both / None).
2. **Hover a road** to see a preview of zoning cells.
3. **Right-Click** to cycle previews:
   - **Left ↔ Right** when any side icon is selected.
   - **Both ↔ None** when Both or None is selected.
4. **Left-Click** once to apply.
5. **Optional:** **Shift+Z** shortcut to open the tool panel (not required).

> Tip: Right-Click multiple times to preview different outcomes, then Left-Click once to commit.

## Compatibility
- Safe to remove anytime.
- Does not use Harmony; safe/compatible (less likely to break with game updates).
- Designed to be minimal and low-conflict (extends vanilla UI panel instead of replacing it)
- Uses the game’s input system so that RMB sounds and selection feedback mirror vanilla behavior.

---

## Notes
- Make sure you’re hovering a **road segment** that supports zoning cells (e.g., not a highway).

---

## Roadmap / Future
- **Topography (Contour Lines) support tool** in the same mini-panel (vanilla icon/tooltip).  
  Goal: toggle contour lines next to the ART-Zone controls for easier terrain-aware zoning.
